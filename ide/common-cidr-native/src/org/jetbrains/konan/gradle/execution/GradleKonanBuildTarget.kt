     * Each non-test build target should have null recorded in [baseBuildTarget].
     *
     * Each test build target should have non-null [baseBuildTarget] pointing to non-test build target created
     * for the same MPP Native target.
     *
     * This is necessary to avoid creating run configurations for test executables if there are non-test
     * artifacts (executables, libraries, etc) created for the same MPP Native target. In such case run configuration
     * will be created only for non-test artifact. But user may choose to edit run configuration and switch
     * targets/executables between non-test and test ones.
     *
     * Example 1: "Hello World" project. One MPP Native target. Three executable artifacts:
     * 1. application (release)
     * 2. application (debug)
     * 3. test (debug)
     *
     * The first two artifacts will be united in a single "non-test" [GradleKonanBuildTarget] that will have null
     * in [baseBuildTarget]. The third artifact will be added to the second "test" [GradleKonanBuildTarget] who's
     * [baseBuildTarget] will reference to just created "non-test" [GradleKonanBuildTarget].
     *
     * The logic that creates run configurations will look at [baseBuildTarget] of every [GradleKonanBuildTarget],
     * and if there is null it will take the [GradleKonanBuildTarget] itself. Finally, resulting in creation
     * of a run configuration only for "non-test" [GradleKonanBuildTarget].
     *
     * Example 2: A project with the single MPP Native target that does not define any output kinds. Only single
     * artifact will be produced by such project - test executable.
     *
     * Only one "test" [GradleKonanBuildTarget] will be created for such project. And as far as there is no the
     * appropriate "non-test" [GradleKonanBuildTarget] the [baseBuildTarget] property will be left null.
     *
     * As a result the single run configuration will be created that will run test executable.
